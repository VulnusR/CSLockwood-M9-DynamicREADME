  ## Installation

  To install Dynamic README simply create a fork of this repo, and open the program in your text editor of choice. Dynamic README requires node v16 specifcally, please refer to the node installation documentation if you do not currently have node. Additionally if you have nvm,  and multiple installations of node you can use nvm switch 16 to change your node version for proper Dynamic README functionality. 

  ## Usage

  Once you have Dynamic README installed and are running the proper version of node (v16) you can simply open the program in your code editor of choice. Open a terminal within your code editor and run "node index.js" in the command line. You will be given a series of prompts to respond to. If you would rather leave a field blank so you can manually edit it later, simply hit enter without entering anything into the command line. This will ensure that the area is ready for you to manualy develop yourself, the program will generate some very basic text as a placeholder for your convience. Additionally there are some optional fields, the prompts will imply this by saying things like "if you want" or "if none leave blank"--simply enter info if you desire it or leave the line blank and hit enter if you do not want that field. At the end of answering all the prompts in the command line your README will be generated.
